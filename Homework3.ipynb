For assign the point we used the Fibonacci's sequences, in this way we think and hope to give a good distribution for the points, we should have the biggest gap between first and second, a smaller than the previously gap between second and third and so on. In this way we hope that we are giving the right priority to the cities where the users would like to live. Let's have a look to the code: first of all we used a set for find the cities. "
